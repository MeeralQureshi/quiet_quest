# 💤 QuietQuest

**QuietQuest** is a calming side project built by me, a mom and software engineer, to help myself and other moms turn baby nap time into moments of focus and self-care (because we deserve some me-time too!)
It’s a simple React app designed to schedule “quests” (tasks) during nap sessions (or even wake-windows). Just add a nap session, the quests you want to get done during that time, and start checking things off!

> “Built during naps, with vibes and AI assistance (Cursor)”

- ✅ **Quests** – Create short, focused tasks organized by nap session. You can even tag these with how long they will take and how much energy you'll need!
- 💾 **LocalStorage** – Your data stays safe without sign-ins  
- 🎨 **Soothing UI** – Calming dark blues, rounded cards, and playful icons

## 💡 Inspiration

I built this because I wanted to be more productive while my baby was napping. I essentially wanted a way to organize tasks by nap/wake-windows. Inspired by:

- 🐉 The games I play with "side-quests"
- 🌙 Dark mode/cozy aesthetics
- 🤖 Wanting to try out "vibe-coding" with Cursor
